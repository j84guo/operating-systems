There are two types of sockets :

1) Unix sockets are an IPC communication mechanism allowing data transfer (via the kernel) between processes of the same opereating system. They are special files
   created with capabilities/restrictions facilitating processes to communicate by reading/writing to it.
 
2) Network sockets are a mechanism for communicating between processes over a network, they are an abstraction of an endpoint. Generally sockets are created and used 
   via an API like the POSIX socket API. A TCP socket encapsulates and IP address and port.

Socket vs Port :

IP address -> Routes data to a specific host on the network.
Port -> Routes to a specific socket on the host (not necessarily one process).
Socket -> The object a process uses to talk to the OS about a specific connection, like a file descriptor.
