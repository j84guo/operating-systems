System :

1) out of the 5-6 states you can find under ps, which two take up system memory
Answer ------> Processes can be new (pending resource allocation and admission), ready (awaiting dispatch), running (intructions in CPU), waiting (pending I/O like user input or disk read) or terminated (removed from memory). Since waiting processes are usually swapped to disk, ready and running are states which take up memory.

2) what is a zombie process ***improve***
Answer ------> When a child wants to end, it releases its data structures and sends a signal to the kernel 
that it is finished, then the kernel removes it from the process table. In between sending the signal and 
having its PCB removed, the process is a zombie. 

3) what happens when you type ls -l in the terminal
Answer ------> 
0. The command displays files and directories in the pwd, along with permissions, owners and created date/time.
1. The shell checks if ls is an alias.
2. If not, it checks if it is a built in.
3. If not, it searches its PATH variable for an ls executable. (probably found at /usr/bin/ls) 
4. Once found, the shell will fork() itself and then use exec() to replace itself with the image of the executable.
5. The ls process executes and exists, sending output to the terminal.

4) What is swap and how is it used? What are come use cases.

5) what are process groups and thread groups

6) what are signals

7) what signal kills a process

-how does the system manage memory and what are the tradeoffs
-what does it mean when you have many system interrupts
-what is a signal and how is it handled by the kernel
-cache vs buffer
-how would you design a cache api

-what is a file system and how does it work
-what are file descriptors and how do they work

-write a performance monitoring script
-Suppose there is a server with high CPU load but there is no process with high CPU time. What could be the reason for that? How do you 
debug this problem? Does your solution always work, and if not, what's the reason for that?
-a write operation failed with an error, how do you figure out what happened 
-how file globbing works
-how to improve database with slow I/O

/***********
Networking :
***********/

-where is dns file
-why wouldn't you want a root DNS server to answer queries for you, instead of delegating you to an authoritative server?  
-what is the type of record that resolves url's to ip records?  
-what tcp headers does traceroute modify
-In IPv6 what is the A record equivalent?  
-what is your favourite networking protocol
-common port names (http, https, dns, ssh)
-What options do you have, nefarious or otherwise, to stop people on a wireless network you are also on (but have no admin rights to) 
from hogging bandwidth by streaming videos?  
-what happens when a client makes a request for a website

/*******
Coding :
*******/ 
-operations on data files (counting, filter, sort, implement formula)
-re-implement tail in scripting language
-most efficient sort (radix/counting, quicksort, mergesort)
-write a script to contact 100 hosts, look for a process and then sends an email report
-clean bad words from a text file
-Given a sentence convert the sentence to the modified pig-latin language:
 Words beginning with a vowel, remove the vowel letter and append the letter to the end.
 All words append the letters 'ni' to the end.
 All words incrementally append the letter 'j'. i.e. 'j','jj','jjj', etc...
